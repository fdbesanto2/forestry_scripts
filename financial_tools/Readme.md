# Yields.py
This script contains three functions.

1.  An annual simple growth rate calculator.
	This calculates the annual growth rate using the simple interest formaula.  Values can be in
	any format as long as they are numeric (e.g.; dollars, tree diameter inside bark, yields/acre, etc.)
	
2.  A future yield calculator.
	Given the rate of simple interest and current yield, this calculates the future yield.
	
3.  An annual compound growth rate calculator.
	This calculates the annual compound rate of growth given a current value, future value and number
	of periods.  Again, values can be in any numeric format (e.g. they can represent dollars,
	tree diameters, yields/acre, etc.)
